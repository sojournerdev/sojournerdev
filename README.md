<small>Developer · Infrastructure · Reliability</small>

I work on infrastructure. I try my best to be a good colleague.

## Lately
- Learning to let go of who I thought I was, and understand who I actually am
- Noticing where discipline is missing, and sitting with that honestly
- Working on cloud infrastructure and nudging my role toward platform engineering

## Notes to self
- Remember who loved you first
- It’s okay not to know everything
- Building a career is a gift, not a measure of worth
